# SQL_For_Data_Science

In this course, I learn how to use SQL in order analyze a dataset from Yelp.

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. 

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

# Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL

Write a query and table creation statement to make final_assignments_qa look like the final_assignments table. If you discovered something missing in part 1, you may fill in the value with a place holder of the appropriate data type.

Use the final_assignments table to calculate the order binary for the 30 day window after the test assignment for item_test_2 (You may include the day the test started)

Use the final_assignments table to calculate the view binary, and average views for the 30 day window after the test assignment for item_test_2. (You may include the day the test started)

Use the https://thumbtack.github.io/abba/demo/abba.html to compute the lifts in metrics and the p-values for the binary metrics ( 30 day order binary and 30 day view binary) using a interval 95% confidence.

Use Mode’s Report builder feature to write up the test. Your write-up should include a title, a graph for each of the two binary metrics you’ve calculated. The lift and p-value (from the AB test calculator) for each of the two metrics, and a complete sentence to interpret the significance of each of the results.
 
 ## Metrics Found From Analysis
      View Binary 
      We can say with 95% confidence that the lift value is 2% and the p_value is 0.2. 
    There is not a significant difference in the number of views within 30days of the assigned treatment date between the two treatments.

      Order binary
      There is no detectable change in this metric. The p-value is 0.86  
      meaning that there is a no significant difference in the number of orders within 30days of the assigned treatment date between      the two treatments.
