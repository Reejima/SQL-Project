3. Find the distribution of star ratings to the business in the following cities:

i. Avon

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT SUM(review_count) AS reviews, stars
FROM Business B 
Where City = 'Avon'
Group by stars


Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns � star rating and count):
+---------+-------+
| reviews | stars |
+---------+-------+
|      10 |   1.5 |
|       6 |   2.5 |
|      88 |   3.5 |
|      21 |   4.0 |
|      31 |   4.5 |
|       3 |   5.0 |
+---------+-------+

ii. Beachwood

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT SUM(review_count) AS reviews, stars
FROM Business B 
Where City = 'Beachwood'
Group by stars


Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns � star rating and count):

+---------+-------+
| reviews | stars |
+---------+-------+
|       8 |   2.0 |
|       3 |   2.5 |
|      11 |   3.0 |

|      69 |   4.0 |
|      17 |   4.5 |
|      23 |   5.0 |
+---------+-------+

4. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	Select name 
		,review_count
	FROM user
	order by review_count desc
	Limit 3
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
+--------+--------------+
| name   | review_count |
+--------+--------------+
| Gerald |         2000 |
| Sara   |         1629 |
| Yuri   |         1339 |
+--------+--------------+


5. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans? No

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	 It seems that Sara who has 1629 reviews only has 50 fans and Christine who has much fewer reviews - 930 - has 173 fans. 
	 This pattern can be noted throughout the data set which suggests there is no correlation between posing more reivews and the number of fans.

	Select name, 
	 	review_count, 
	 	fans
	FROM user
	order by review_count desc

	
6. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: Yes, there are 1780 for love and 232 for hate.

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer: 
	select count(*) from review where text like '%love%'
	select count(*) from review where text like '%hate%'

	
	
7. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	select name, 
		fans 
	from user
	order by fans desc
	limit 10 
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
		+-----------+------+
| name      | fans |
+-----------+------+
| Amy       |  503 |
| Mimi      |  497 |
| Harald    |  311 |
| Gerald    |  253 |
| Christine |  173 |
| Lisa      |  159 |
| Cat       |  133 |
| William   |  126 |
| Fran      |  124 |
| Lissa     |  120 |
+-----------+------+
	
	
8. Is there a strong relationship (or correlation) between having a high number of fans and being listed as "useful" or "funny?" Out of the top 10 users with the highest number of fans, what percent are also listed as �useful� or �funny�?

Key:
0% - 25% - Low relationship
26% - 75% - Medium relationship
76% - 100% - Strong relationship
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	select name, 
		fans, 
		useful, 
		funny   
	from user
	where (useful > 0 and funny > 0) 
	order by fans asc
	
	select name, 
		fans, 
		useful, 
		funny   
	from user
	order by fans desc
	limit 10 

	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	+-----------+------+--------+--------+
	| name      | fans | useful |  funny |
	+-----------+------+--------+--------+
	| Amy       |  503 |   3226 |   2554 |
	| Mimi      |  497 |    257 |    138 |
	| Harald    |  311 | 122921 | 122419 |
	| Gerald    |  253 |  17524 |   2324 |
	| Christine |  173 |   4834 |   6646 |
	| Lisa      |  159 |     48 |     13 |
	| Cat       |  133 |   1062 |    672 |
	| William   |  126 |   9363 |   9361 |
	| Fran      |  124 |   9851 |   7606 |
	| Lissa     |  120 |    455 |    150 |
	+-----------+------+--------+--------+
	
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	If I look at the overall data set and I look if the users have been listed as funny or useful, I can see that not all users have fans even if they fit the criteria. 
	It does not seem that being useful or funny correlates to having more fans.
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.



i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

The two groups who have 2-3.5 stars have slightly shorter hours and one business is only open 6 days a week. 

The 4.0 star business is open 7 days a week for around 10 hours every day. Do note that only 3 businesses showed up so it is not a large sample size.


SQL Code:
select name, 
	stars, 
	review_count, 
	is_open, 
	hours, 
	CATEGORY 
	from business b 
JOIN Hours h on b.id = h.business_id
Join CATEGORY C ON h.business_iD= C.business_id
where city = 'Charlotte' 
AND category = 'Shopping'


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

The two groups do have different number of reviews. The group with 2-3.5 stars has slightly more reviews than the group with 4 stars. The average number of reviews for the 2-3.5 stars is around 8 and for 4.0 stars it is 5. 

select stars, avg(review_count) from business b 
JOIN Hours h on b.id = h.business_id
Join CATEGORY C ON h.business_iD= C.business_id
where city = 'Charlotte' 
AND category = 'Shopping'
Group by stars
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
No, I am not since all 3 businesses have 3 different zip codes.

SQL code used for analysis:
select name, stars,  CATEGORY, postal_code from business b 
JOIN Hours h on b.id = h.business_id
Join CATEGORY C ON h.business_iD= C.business_id
where city = 'Charlotte' 
AND category = 'Shopping'
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         The businesses that are open have more reviews then the ones that are closed.
         
ii. Difference 2:
         The average stars for restaurants that are open are 3.785 and the ones that are closed 3.5.
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT   AVG(b.review_count),
			   SUM(b.review_count),
			   AVG(stars),
			   is_open
		FROM business b
		INNER JOIN Tip t on b.id = t.business_id 
		INNER JOIN User u on t.user_id = u.id 
		GROUP BY is_open
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.	

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         I would like to predict the overall star rating for a food related business.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
        In order to predict star rating for food related restaurants I pulled categories that dealt with food such as bakerires, restaurants, etc. And then pulled the name of a restaurant and the area that it is located, the average star rating and total number of reviews each one recieved. The reason I pulled the area, category, and total number of reviews is to see if they have influence over how the star rating is. 

        The last item that I pulled is the attributes related to each restaurant in each category since that can drive ratings. For example, each type of restaurant may have different set of expectations that may make it successful. In the case of coffee and tea places, people are looking for ambience and WiFi where as for SeaFood places it is more about the alcohol and the ambience so if the attribute is not there for certain restaurants then the ratings could go down.
